    "The main technology used to develop this website was Next.js. It was chosen for its capability to merge server-side and client-side rendering, while enabling the website to retain the interactivity of a React application.",
    "Server components are rendered on the server and sent as HTML to the client. In contrast, client-side components are pre-rendered and then sent to the client for hydration, allowing for enhanced interactivity.",
    "Next.js offers features such as handling redirects, code splitting, generating XML sitemaps, and server-side rendering, which collectively make it an excellent tool for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). These features help optimize the website's performance and structure, making it more search engine-friendly and enhancing its visibility and ranking in search results."
