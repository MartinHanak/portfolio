Combined with my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I'm able to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces.",

  "tools": "During my studies, I became acquainted with many useful tools that I now use on a daily basis. I utilize Git and GitHub for version control of my applications, Jest for testing, and VSCode as my go-to code editor.
